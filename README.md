CS-210 Portfolio Project Reflection

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
I chose the Airgead Banking project for my portfolio. The program calculates investment growth over time based on user input for the initial amount, monthly deposit, annual interest rate, and number of years. It solves the problem of helping users understand how their investments grow, both with and without monthly contributions.

What did you do particularly well?
I did a good job keeping the code organized and the output clear. The formatting of the financial report looks professional, and the logic flows smoothly from input to calculation to display. Everything runs consistently without errors.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I could strengthen the program by adding more input validation to prevent invalid data from being entered. Iâ€™d also refine a few loops to make the program run more efficiently. These changes would make the code more reliable and secure in real-world use.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part was getting the compound interest formulas right and ensuring the results matched what users would expect. I tested the math repeatedly and used class notes and online resources to confirm my calculations. Debugging each step helped me understand how small errors affected the output.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project helped me strengthen my debugging and problem-solving skills, as well as my ability to organize code logically. It also improved my comfort with GitHub and version control, which are essential for any software engineering work.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I kept the code clean and easy to read with consistent indentation, descriptive variable names, and clear comments. Each part of the program is separated into logical sections, so it can be updated easily if new features or calculations are added later.
